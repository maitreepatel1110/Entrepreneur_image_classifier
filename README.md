# Entrepreneur_image_classifier
Overview
This project is a web-based application that allows users to classify images of the top 5 worldwide entrepreneurs (Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett) and top 5 Indian entrepreneurs (Mukesh Ambani, Ratan Tata, Gautam Adani, Azim Premji, Narayana Murthy). It uses a drag-and-drop interface for image input, identifies the entrepreneur using OpenCV and an SVM model, and displays their business history, key achievements, and a regression line graph showing business stats from the last five years.

Features
1.Image Classification: Drag and drop an image of an entrepreneur, and the app identifies them using an SVM model with OpenCV for image preprocessing.
2.Business Information: Displays a summary of the entrepreneur's business history, major achievements, and milestones.
3.Graph Visualization: Shows a regression line graph of the entrepreneur's business stats (revenue, stock price, or other financial data) over the past five years.
4.Responsive Interface: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy interaction.
5.Flask Deployment: Backend server powered by Python Flask.

Technologies Used
1.OpenCV: For image processing and preprocessing.
2.SVM (Support Vector Machine): For image classification.
3.Matplotlib: For plotting the regression line graph.
4.Flask: Backend server and API integration.
5.HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend user interface.
